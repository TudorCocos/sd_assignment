# Banking-Service
** work in progress **
A banking service developed using Spring, but still a lot to learn in using Spring and a lot left to finish this project

The banking services can be accesed through Swagger:

## Employee apis: 
- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/Account
- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/Client

## Admin apis:
- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/Employee

## Calling the service apis:
- each api call is protected with credentials that are stored in the database

!Note: the database script in /sqlscript is not up-to-date as it does not contain the employee table
